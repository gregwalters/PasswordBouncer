Password Bouncer v1

Usage: java -jar PasswordBouncer.jar

Need to have a password handy for scripts and can't keep it on the filesystem? 
Enter your password, then background the process using whatever method your OS supports.
To retrieve your password send "MYPASSWORD" to localhost port 10128.

Usage in a bash script would be like this:

MYPASSWORD=`exec 3<>/dev/tcp/localhost/10128 ; echo -e "MYPASSWORD\n">&3 ; cat <&3`

then you can use the $MYPASSWORD variable when you need the password.
